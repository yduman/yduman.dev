Hey, I'm Yadu. Welcome to my digital garden! Everything that you see here is written by me and revolves around my own opinion and findings. The purpose is to share knowledge and sometimes some non-trivial topics that you usually encounter in real life projects. 

Currently, I work as a Lead Software Engineer at [MaibornWolff](https://maibornwolff.de). 

Over the years, I found a passion for creating tailored software together with talented people. I work primarily in a full-stack/cross-platform landscape, using any programming language that does the job. I am also coaching people, helping them grow in their career and giving them some tips & tricks on how to become a successful engineer. In projects, I care a lot about rich and proactive communication. It's the most important skill any engineer should have in my opinion. 

Apart from work, I usually do things to cool off. Most often I play video games with friends where we just chill and talk nonsense. Occasionally, I enjoy some night drives that I find super relaxing or I read stuff that I find interesting.
